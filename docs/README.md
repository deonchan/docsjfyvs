For the old projects that are already running Docsify or you initialized using `docsify-cli`, you should have a look at [devcontainers](https://kosalanuwan/devcontainers/#readme). But, for new projects, luckily, we have enabled [the repository](https://github.com/alertbox/vscode-remote-try-docsify/generate/) as a GitHub Template repository so you can simply Docsify yourself.

- Best for GitHub Pages
- Built as a GitHub Template repository
- Built with Docsify in mind
- No need of install packages locally
- Supports Markdown and Docisy doc help syntax
- Maintained by [the Alertbox Team](https://github.com/alertbox/)
- Powered by [Docsify](https://docsify.js.org/) and [VS Code Remote - Containers](https://github.com/kosalanuwan/devcontainers/#readme)

> This template also consist of a few Markdown files inside the `docs/` folder based on the Docsify Boilerplate.

- `_sidebar.md` is the left-side Pane which you can toggle
